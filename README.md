# SkinVision: AI-Powered Skin Disease Detection App

SkinVision is a mobile application that integrates a custom-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect and classify **20 types of skin diseases** using computer vision and deep learning. It empowers users with **instant skin condition analysis** through an intuitive Android interface â€” combining healthcare accessibility with intelligent technology.

## Features

-  Detects 20 common skin conditions using a CNN
-  Android mobile application built with Kotlin
-  Custom-trained Keras model (.h5) using Kaggle dataset
-  Upload or capture skin images for instant predictions
-  Keeps the history of diagnosises
-  Gives Doctors details and Precautions with profile apdation and secure login
-  Firebase integration (secured, no exposed keys)
-  Beginner-friendly UI for public use and research

## Dataset

We used the [20 Skin Diseases Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/haroonalam16/20-skin-diseases-dataset) from Kaggle, containing labeled images for 20 distinct conditions.
Although the dataset is still attached here in the 20_Skin_Diseases folder.

The dataset was split into training and validation sets. Image augmentation and resizing were performed to enhance generalization.

## Model Info

The CNN model was built using **Keras (TensorFlow backend)** with:
- Convolutional layers + ReLU
- MaxPooling
- Dropout
- Dense layers
- Softmax output for multi-class classification

The `.h5` model file was excluded from GitHub due to size limits. You can download it here:

**[Download skinvision_cnn.h5 (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VHDun3VazgGZxK2Y0fukiyLzB9HN3DvN/view?usp=drive_link)**

## Android App Structure

- **Kotlin**-based Android app with image selection, prediction output, and results display
- `MainActivity.kt` handles model input and UI
- Integration with **Firebase ML Kit** (optional features)
- Permissions for camera/gallery included
- Multiple Fragments for every page for all type of screens and better performance of the app

## How to Run This Project

### AI Model (Jupyter Notebook)
1. Open `Skin-disease-cnn.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab
2. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the specified directory
3. Train the model or load the pretrained `.h5` file
4. Run the cell to make predictions

### Android App (SkinVision_app)
1. Open project in **Android Studio**
2. Place the downloaded `skinvision_cnn.h5` in the `assets/` folder (if using local prediction)
3. As the h5 file has a large file size i used tflite model (converted the h5 file into tflite and placed it in assests/ folder in android studio)
4. Sync Gradle and build the app
5. Run the code Flask_API in Visual Studio Code or any platform (MAKE SURE THAT THE IP ADDRESS OF THE FLASK_API, Your computer and the Homefragment.kt has same ip address)
6. Once the Flask_API is running
7. Run on a device or emulator
8. Enjoy the AI predictions and the app
